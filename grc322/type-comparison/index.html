The typeface was cut into metal by John Handy, a punchcutter. The main reason behind this typeface being made was a part of an ambitious project to create books of the greatest possible quality. Because of this, Baskerville became very popular in book design. Also, Baskerville was intended as a refinement of old-styler typefaces from the creation period.</p>
